So the plan is to have a Mbed device that we can control a room from using
MTTQ to transfer the data over the wifi.

To demo this we are going to create a Room application to simulate the mbed being used.

Therefore we have two different java applications!

(i am pretty sure having both in the same repo should be fine)

Tasks
- set up mbed project with Will's test project
- set up Room to revecive test signals

- create a wrapper class and methods for transferring data through MTTQ
	- potentailly creating very simple library that both mbed and room can use

- write methods to allow mbed to be control the MTTQ
- via button presses so will need to create mini GUI??

Room
- create mbed state emulator (very simple)
- make sure backend and front end are seperate
- create GUI using swing
- have lights and stuff work! (using OOP)


Difficulties
- GUI swing stuff
- MTTQ wrapper
- using package directory
- team work as this is a very large project
